            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſooner hazard themſelves through an Ocean of Errour in their old Leaky Bark, than bring it into

As if with the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> They thought it
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to ſweep a Room after it has contracted the duſt of three Generations:</p>
            <p>Indeed though <hi>Admiration</hi> be the uſual daughter of Folly, yet a Wiſeman may be

Auſterities of ſome other Orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe will be found main props to uphold this tottering Kingdome of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Out of which it yet ſometimes pleaſes Almighty God (maugre all the Bird-lime of Satan)
wonderfully to draw ſome particular Perſons; as in that Remarkable Inſtance which gives Birth
to all this, (perhaps too tedious, yet we hope not altogether Impertinent Diſcourſe.)</p>
            <p>A <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryer, (whether <hi>Portugueze</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> by Birth, our
Information cannot aſſure us, and we would not impoſe on the Reader in ſo ſerious a
Relation, the leaſt jot of Fancy.</p>
            <p>Certain it is he was educated from his infancy in the <hi>Romiſh Faith</hi> beyond the Seas,
and being of a grave well diſpos'd pious temper, when he grew up to the more advanced years of
Diſcretion, he reſolved to enter into Religion, (as they call it) that is to turn
<hi>Monk,</hi> as the neareſt and ſpeedieſt Cut to Heaven; but then ſurveying the ſeveral
allureing Orders (wherewith that Church well Emblem'd by a Serpents ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Skin, is variouſly
ſpeckled.) He could not think any of them ſtrict enough for his Devotion, but that of the
moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and ſelf mortifying <hi>Capuchin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that rigid Society he Liſts himſelf, and with much Zeal and a great deal of applauſe
continued amongſt them ſeveral years, and though the active Diſloyal Loyalliſts or
Fraternity of Jeſus (As they Impiouſly enough ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) do generally arrogate the
glory of all Learning, and ſtrive to perſwade the World that all the other orders are but meer
Sotts and Ignoramouſſes, fit only with their yeilding Aſſes-Backs to bear or undertake what
ever deſperate Load or deſigne the Politick Conclave ſhall think fit to Impoſe on them,
whom they hold faſt ſhakled to the Holy See by a vow of blind obedience, as well as voluntary
Poverty, yet we know that there want not amongſt both the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50072:4"/>
               <hi>Franciſcans</hi> Perſons excellently accompliſht, with all kind of Literature, And ſuch
was our <hi>Capuchin,</hi> well ſtiled in Language, in Philoſophy, and in Divinity too, As
their ſtinted Students would permit, in which reſpect he was thought not unfitly qualified to
be ſent into <hi>England</hi> to officiate and promote the Catholique Religion?</p>
            <p>Being here ſomewhat remor'd from the continual Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his rigid Superiors wary Eye,
he took the boldneſs to gratify his Curioſity a little in peruſing the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and
meetting there St. <hi>Paul's Try all things,</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that deſperate Liberty to read
the writtings of ſeveral of our ableſt Divines concerning Points in Controverſie, Like a
noble Berean he compares our proof with the Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs Arguments, and both, with the unerring Rule
of Gods Word.</p>
            <p>He no ſooner had waded into this Examination, but a ſtrange Tempeſt ariſes in his Soul,
He finds by that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Balance a ſad Mene Tekel inſcribed on moſt of <hi>Romes</hi>
Doctrines, and perceives thoſe gawdy ornaments wherewith ſhe is wont to trick up her ſelf to
allure unwary ſpectators, are only meritricious paintings, or uſurped Embeliſhment, and
begins to be aſhamed of theſe darling Popperies, which before he eſteemed his Glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeeds of his Converſion a further and deliberate Reading, and ſome Converſe with
ſome of our Orthodox Divines in ſhort time Ripened to a Ioyful Harveſt, when he openly
Profeſt his Concurrence in all things with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and his deſires to
be admitted and received into her Embraces and Communion.</p>
            <p>But further and more ſignally to Teſtify by ſome vert Art, his total denyal of the
Romiſh opinions, and Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of theſe Orders he had received from thence, His Zeal
prompts him to a very remarkable performance, For, behold! on Satuaday laſt being the Eighth of
this Inſtant <hi>March;</hi> he freely of his own Accord repairs into the <hi>Pallace-Yard</hi>
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> about 4. or 5. a Clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50072:4"/>
and there having ſent for ſome Fagots, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Fire, he took his <hi>Beads,</hi> a
<hi>Crucifix,</hi> ſome Popiſh <hi>Maſs-Book</hi> his <hi>Cowls</hi> and the whole Habit of
his Order, and there very reverendly Burnt them in the preſence of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Crowd, whom he
deſired to take notice,
<q rend="margQuotes">That he did that unexpected Action, to witneſs to them and the world
his ſorrow for and deteſtation of thoſe Errors and ridiculous Vanities of the Church of Rome,
wherein he had been hitherto brought up and with formerly he had a great value for; But that he did
now abſolutely renounce that Church, and would heartily ſubſcribe in all things with the
Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Eſtabliſht <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After which publique declaration of his mind in terms very ſober and ſignificant he departed
ſeeming very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his rare Burnt offering.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be doubted, but the Romiſh Emiſſaries (who have ever been known for the moſt
dexterous Contrivers, and exacteſt Maſters of Calumny) will have a Flood of ſlanders to vimit
forth after this Poor Man, ſometimes perhaps that will ſuggeſt, that he is a Cheat, was never
a Catholique ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Orders &amp;c. but when that is proved beyond the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of a
<hi>Jeſuits</hi> denyal, they will next inſinuate, that he was Frantick, diſtemper'd in mind,
has been a long time diſtracted, but we are well acquainted with thoſe litle Arts of
<hi>Rome:</hi> remember the ſame aſperſions on <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and know
of whom it was ſaid of old, <hi>He ſaw a Devil and is mad;</hi> As there are enow credible
Gentlemen in Town that knowing this perſon beyond the Seas, can Evidence his being a real
<hi>Capuchin,</hi> ſo his free rational diſcourſes to all whoſe Curioſity leads them to
viſit him ſufficiently diſpels that pittiful objection of his diſtraction.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore ſay no more, but conclude with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wiſhes, That the Converſion
and Zeal of this quondam <hi>Fryer,</hi> may invite others of thoſe poor enſlaved Orders, to
